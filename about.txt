Bitcointip Bot How-To:

The bitcointip bot allows redditors to tip each other small amounts of money through a reddit comment or PM.  To initially fund your bitcointip account, you have to send bitcoins to the bitcoin address that the bitcointip bot gives you.  Once you do that, you can tip a user or bitcoin address in a comment or PM to the bitcointip bot.  After you send a tip, the bot will make a reply verifying or rejecting the tip.  If the redditor you are tipping does not have a bitcointip account, one will be created for them.  If they don't accept the tip within 21 days, the transaction will be reversed and you'll get your money back (minus a tiny fee*). 

*Fees for each tip are currently 0.0005 BTC (~0.006 USD).
